# Cyber Defence Frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK)

## Overview
This project explores the MITRE ATT&CK framework and how it is used in real SOC workflows to understand, investigate and communicate attacker behavior. The focus is on how analysts apply ATT&CK to add context to alerts, map threat activity, and support detection and response efforts.

Rather than treating ATT&CK as a theory-only framework, this project looks at it from a practical defensive perspective.

---

## 1. Objective
Develop a working understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and demonstrate how attacker behavior can be mapped to tactics and techniques during investigations.

## 2. MITRE and ATT&CK Background

### MITRE
MITRE is a non for-profit organization that develops research based frameworks and tools used across the cyber security industry. Many of these resources are widely adopted by SOCs, threat intelligence teams, and security vendors.

### MITRE ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world attacks. It provides a consistent way to describe how attackers operate and is commonly used to:
- Add context to alerts and incidents
- Map attacker behavior during investigations
- Improve detection coverage and response planning
