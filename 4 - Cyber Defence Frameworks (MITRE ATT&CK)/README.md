# Cyber Defence Frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK)

## Overview
This project explores the MITRE ATT&CK framework and its role in modern SOC operations. It covers how ATT&CK organizes adversary behavior into tactics and techniques and why this framework is widely used across defensive security teams.

---

## 1. Objective
Demonstrate the ability to analyze attacker activity and map observed behavior to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques during a security investigation.

---

## 2. MITRE and ATT&CK Background

### MITRE
MITRE is a non for-profit organization that develops research based frameworks and tools used across the cyber security industry. Many of these resources are widely adopted by SOCs, threat intelligence teams, and security vendors.

### MITRE ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world attacks. It provides a consistent way to describe how attackers operate and is commonly used to:
- Add context to alerts and incidents
- Map attacker behavior during investigations
- Improve detection coverage and response planning
