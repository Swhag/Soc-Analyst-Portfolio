# SOC L1 Alert Triage

## Overview
This document explains how alerts are formed, prioritized, and triaged by SOC Level 1 analysts.  
It covers the workflow from event creation → alert generation → prioritization → triage → final verdict.

This foundational knowledge prepares for all technical projects in this portfolio (Splunk, Elastic, Wireshark, endpoint detection, phishing, etc.).

## 1. From Events to Alerts
Security alerts originate from normal system activity:

1. An **event** occurs (login, process creation, file download).  
2. The system logs the event.  
3. Logs are forwarded to a **SIEM** or **EDR**. 
4. Detection rules evaluate the logs and generate an **alert**.  
5. Alerts highlight suspicious activity so analysts don’t have to manually review millions of raw logs.

## 2. Alert Management Platforms
Alerts may appear in:

- **SIEM** (Splunk ES, Elastic)  
- **EDR/NDR** (Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike)  
- **SOAR** (Splunk SOAR, Cortex)  
- **ITSM systems** (TheHive, Jira)

Most SOCs centralize alerts in SIEM or SOAR for consistent triage.

## 3. Alert Properties
Common alert fields:

- **Alert Time** – when the alert triggered  
- **Alert Name** – summary of suspicious behavior  
- **Severity** – Low to Critical  
- **Status** – New → In Progress → Resolved  
- **Verdict** – True Positive / False Positive  
- **Assignee** – analyst responsible for triage  
- **Description** – detection logic + explanation  
- **Alert Fields** – hostname, user, IP, command line, file hash, etc.

## 4. Alert Prioritization
To manage large alert volumes, analysts follow a standard priority order:

1. **Filter** alerts already assigned  
2. **Sort by severity** (Critical → Low)  
3. **Sort by age** (oldest first)

This ensures fast response to critical or time-sensitive threats.

## 5. Triage Workflow

### **Initial Actions**
- Assign the alert to yourself  
- Change status to **In Progress**  
- Review alert name, description, severity, and indicators  

### **Investigation**
- Identify the affected user/host  
- Understand what the alert describes (login anomaly, malware, phishing, etc.)  
- Review surrounding events before/after the alert  
- Use threat intelligence (IPs, domains, hashes)  
- Compare activity against normal behavior baselines  

### **Final Actions**
- Determine **True Positive** or **False Positive**  
- Clearly document your reasoning  
- Close the alert or escalate  
- Update alert status accordingly

## Conclusion
This triage workflow demonstrates core L1 responsibilities:

- Understanding alert context  
- Prioritizing effectively  
- Conducting structured investigation  
- Making correct verdict decisions  

This serves as the starting point for deeper technical projects in the portfolio.
