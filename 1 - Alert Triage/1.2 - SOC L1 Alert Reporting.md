# SOC L1 Alert Reporting & Escalation

## Overview
Alert reporting and escalation are essential SOC Level 1 responsibilities.  
This document explains how to write clear alert comments, structure professional reports, escalate alerts properly, and communicate with other teams.

This content complements the SOC L1 Alert Triage workflow.

## 1. Purpose of Alert Reporting
SOC L1 analysts write reports when:

- The alert is a **True Positive**  
- L2 analysts need context for deeper investigation  
- Remediation or containment may be required  
- Long-term alert context must be preserved  

### Why reporting matters

| Purpose | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Provide context for L2 | Prevents repeated analysis and saves time |
| Preserve findings | Alerts are kept indefinitely vs logs may expire |
| Improve investigation skills | Documenting clearly strengthens your understanding |

## 2. The 5 Ws Reporting Framework
A strong alert report answers:

- **Who** – the user or entity involved  
- **What** – the suspicious activity or event  
- **When** – timeline (start and end time)  
- **Where** – hostname, IP, system, website  
- **Why** – reasoning behind your verdict (most important)

Reports must be concise, accurate, and self-contained.

## 3. When to Escalate
Escalate alerts when:

- A major cyberattack is possible  
- Host isolation or credential reset is required  
- Malware or persistence is suspected  
- Critical assets/business services are impacted  
- You need senior guidance  

### Escalation Flow
1. Write a clear, complete alert report  
2. Assign the alert to the on-shift L2 analyst  
3. Notify L2 (chat or verbal)  
4. Provide any additional context requested  
5. L2 conducts deeper analysis and remediation

## 4. Communication Best Practices
SOC analysts regularly collaborate with IT, HR, system owners, cloud teams, and management.

Recommended guidelines:

- Do **not** contact users through compromised accounts  
- Use emergency contacts if L2 is unreachable during a critical alert  
- Inform L2 if you are overwhelmed by sudden alert spikes  
- Report misclassifications immediately  
- Notify SOC engineers if logs are missing or SIEM parsing breaks  

Clear communication helps prevent miscoordination during real attacks.

## Conclusion
Alert reporting and escalation complete the SOC L1 workflow:

- Writing clear, structured reports  
- Escalating alerts appropriately  
- Communicating effectively with other teams  

These skills help ensure efficient triage, investigation, and incident handling across the SOC.
