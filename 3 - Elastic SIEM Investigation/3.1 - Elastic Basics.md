# Elastic Basics

# Overview 
This project demonstrates how the Elastic Stack (ELK) is used for log analysis within a SOC workflow.  
We will follow the process of exploring Kibana, performing KQL searches, analyzing VPN logs, and creating visualizations and dashboards.

## 1. Objective

- Understand the components of the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Beats, Kibana)  
- Navigate Kibana’s Discover, Visualization, and Dashboard features  
- Use KQL (Kibana Query Language) to filter and investigate logs  
- Analyze VPN logs for anomalies and suspicious activity  
- Build visualizations and a custom VPN dashboard

## 2. Elastic Stack Overview

### Elasticsearch  
Search and analytics engine that stores JSON documents and provides full-text search across indexed data.

### Logstash  
Data pipeline engine with input, filter, and output stages.  
Commonly used to normalize data before sending it to Elasticsearch.

### Beats  
Lightweight host-based agents used to ship logs and telemetry.  
Examples: Winlogbeat (Windows logs), Filebeat (log files), Packetbeat (network flows).

### Kibana  
Web interface for analysts to search, filter, visualize, and build dashboards from Elasticsearch data.

### Data Flow (High-Level)  
1. Beats collect logs from endpoints  
2. Logstash normalizes and forwards data  
3. Elasticsearch indexes and stores events  
4. Kibana provides the interface for analysis and investigation

## 3. Kibana Discover Interface

The **Discover** tab is the primary workspace for analysts. It provides:

- Raw events  
- Field list with value counts  
- Time filter  
- Timeline histogram  
- KQL search bar  
- Filter creation using GUI  
- Ability to build clean tables from selected fields  

### Key Elements
- **Index Pattern:** Logical grouping of logs (e.g., `vpn_connections`)  
- **Fields Pane:** Normalized fields extracted from logs  
- **Search Bar:** Accepts KQL queries  
- **Time Filter:** Controls event visibility  
- **Timeline:** Displays event frequency over time  
- **Add Filter:** GUI-based field filtering

## 4. KQL Searches (Filtering & Investigation)

KQL supports two main types of searches.

### Free-Text Search
Searches for whole terms across all fields.
